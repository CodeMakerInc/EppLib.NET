Have a look at the How to section for code examples and recipes.\r\n\r\n*As of this moment only the .CA registry (CIRA) has been tested with this library. I will update this list as it is confirmed it works properly with other registries.","tagline":"EppLib.NET is a .NET library implementing the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
