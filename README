EppLib.NET is a .NET library implementing the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)

HOW TO: https://github.com/ademar/EppLib.NET/wiki

EPP (defined in RFC 5730) is a widely adopted protocol used to comunicate between a domain registrar and the different domain name registries* to provision and manage domain names, host names and contact details. 
EppLib.NET provides a library that makes easy for registrars to interact with registries implementing the EPP protocol.

Our library is a complete implementation of the EPP specification. Have a look at the How to section for code examples and recipes.

*As of this moment only the .CA registry (CIRA) has been tested with this library. I will update this list as it is confirmed it works properly with other registries.
